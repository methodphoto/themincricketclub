#### Match Report

*from our Cricket Correspondent*

The Min beat the weather to seal a surprisingly emphatic win against perenially tough opponents Middleton Stoney.

The day had begun in traditional style - with a withdrawal. But by way of variation it was an injury committed by a two-year-old, as opposed to a traffic warden (Kitson, 2008), an emotionally bereaved sibling (Kitson, 2009) or a chicken drumstick (Kitson, 2010). So for Mo the Min were grateful for Joe, a promising county 13 year old.

After the shock of seeing 11 present for the start of a match, The Min won the toss and took the field. Wiggy quickly slipped a full toss past one opener, while the skipper's crafty outswinger induced an edge inadvertently ending up in the Gut of Jel. Then as the bowlers continued to apply the pressure the stylish Stoney number 3 provided the pickled egg moment of the match with a skier to Slighty. The plucky taff circled underneath, collective breath was bated - but really there could only be one winner. Wiggy harrumphed, Will chortled, the culprit apologised.

**The Only Way is Jel**

And so it proved as the old maestro rolled around his arm for the 30th Min year and the Middleton Stoney middle order obliged like willing teenagers at their first disco, lying down and giving it up for The Man With No Complaints. A word here too for the Slippers and his perfectly baked deliveries.

114 looked a straightforward score, but as many darkly remarked Goffy had driven a ridiculous distance to get to the match. Surely he would be rewarded with a duck? Earn walloped, Goffy grafted and the Cassandras were silenced with a fabulous opening partnership of 112 - a masterful exhibition in testing conditions, and victory by 9 wickets.

Joint Min of the Match: Goffy and Earn. Honourable mention for Slighty who though unable to locate the flight path of the ball, did at least prevent the skip from trying to drive home via Birmingham.
