#### Match report

*From our Cricket Correspondent*

After 10 weeks with barely any cricket due to incessant bad weather, we finally played an outdoor game of cricket. The previous day thanks to some great planning by Kilmington we played an indoor game in the sports centre in Gillingham (hard G), Dorset, with was a good reliever of frustration but not one to play our way into form.

Outdoors was an entirely different prospect, even though we were playing on Horningsham's arty, the outfield was so wet that water lapped over the sides of boots in the outfield and Jim had to stand on a square of carpet to prevent him sinking and ending up in Portobello, New Zealand.

But first we had to bat which proved to be a concept too far and we were bundled out for 58. Top score was Earn with a meagre 15, but the more notable stat were the hundreds of miles driven on tour by Clan Gallagher, only for them all to be out for the very round score of 0; each and in total.

So to splashing in the shallows of the outfield post tea, where we fared reasonably well.  Kit weaving some leggie magic to take a couple, and Jel nipping in with a couple. But realistically the impossible was unlikely to happen, one good partnership would win it and so it came to pass with C Widdows hitting a useful 20 (he would haunt us in future years too). And that was it.

Still we took the positives; that we played at all and that we didn't drown.
