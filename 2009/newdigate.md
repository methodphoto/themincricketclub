<h3>Match Report</h3><em>From our Cricket Correspondent.</em><br />

<p>There was much that Min followers will recognise in this pleasing win over a strong Newdigate line-up. An innings based on a big score near the top of the order was offset by some cheap wickets given away in the middle order. Highlights included Bes being bowled by a straight full toss, Wigg toe-ending a half-volley to mid-wicket and Slight spooning a wide long-hop to point. And the usual Min running between the wickets was much in evidence with easy twos turned into ones and potential singles becoming zeros.</p>

<p>In the field there were also some familiar sights. Some accurate opening bowling and a couple of early wickets for Harry was followed by more wayward bowling, which allowed Newdigate's big hitters to seize the initiative. At this stage chances were few and far between though there was the traditional sight of a Min fielder at long off rushing in from the boundary for a catch only to see the ball fly over their head for four.</p>  

<p>Yet this win was built on some fairly new developments. The big score at the top of the order did not come from Earn who was absent leaving his heart, or at least his camera, in San Francisco, or Goffy bowled during a hostile and impressive opening spell from Newdigate's main strike bowler for 19. Plaudits instead for Mo, coming in at 3, who confirmed his position as the batsman to catch in the run-scoring stakes this season with a rapid, bludgeoning  73 including five 6s and nine 4s.</p>  

<p>And the final total of 209 was based on a tail that wagged both defiantly and elegantly with Toby scoring an excellent 37 not out including the shot of the day (sorry Mo), a straight drive for four past Newdiagte's main strike bowler. He was well supported by Harry's quick fire 17, which brought some much needed momentum to a faltering innings and 23 from Ned Garland in a ninth wicket partnership of well over 50. Bill Frindall is still to confirm whether this is a Min record.</p>

<p>In the field there were some surprises too. Jel's wicketless season continued, his five overs costing 45 runs. There were other expensive overs around this time too, including one from Wiggy containing successive wide long hops which were predictably dispatched for 4.  Regular Min watchers would not have expected five of six catches to be held in the field including two sharp chances taken by Bes, whose sponsorship deal with Teflon has presumably expired. It was this new found sharpness, along with the usual cunning and guile from Garland who picked up career best figures of 6 for 44 that provided the basis for victory as Newdigate subsided from 120 for 2 to 164 all out.</p>   

<p>Mo also picked up two wickets in a game where everyone, including debutant Raf who shared in a fourth wicket stand of over 50, contributed to the victory. The subsequent news in the curry house that England had beaten India in the Twenty20 World Cup was quite literally the cherry on the cucumber raita to round off a very satisfactory day.</p>
