#### Match Report</h3>

*from our Cricket Correspondent*

A gloriously sunny week preceded a dull and rainy match day. Welcome to a new season. Jel was fretting on the phone to the Bes by 10.30. Skip not in the best of humour dealing with cussed geezas at Travis Perkins. The idea of him really building a rabbit hutch belongs to a parallel universe in which he writes Oscar winning screenplays and his children occasionally lift their heads from an improving book to ask if they might help lay the table. 'No Jel the game's off and I wasn't going to bother to tell you. Of course it's on, and no I don't know what the weather will be doing in Oxfordshire at 3.45'.

With his colleagues' strict instructions (who was that fool who said he wanted 11 captains out there) to win the toss and field ringing in his ears the skip duly called heads and the Min were inserted.

There then followed two and a half hours of the kind of pleasure that Min supporters rarely enjoy. Earn thumped and Barrow stroked their way to a 50 partnership. When Barrow was out Mo (celebrating the arrival of Mikhail by playing 4 games in 7 days) played excellently for 40. Earn reached 50 and then Will and the Skip thrashed around merrily before the entrance of exciting new signing David Wigg. It would be fair to say his abilities had not been over-hyped by his older brother. 'He might make 10'. Wigg,D, is definitely the artist to Wigg, P's craftsman (meow, apologies). Looking as if he might have stepped out of a sepia photograph of the Kent team c 1910 he hit a very elegant 34*. The end result was a sturdy score of 235.

When Britwell batted the Wiggs were again making headlines as the home side were quickly pegged back by mean and hostile bowling from Patrick and Mo. It took a magnificent catch by Mo at deep square leg off Iqbal to effectively end the Britwell challenge, though some hefty late-order tonking sent a flutter through the typically complacent Min ranks. Mention should be made of the five catches  dropped, with the highlight undoubtedly being the skip's, even granted that it came like a tracer bullet out of the sun; he must be highly commended for getting a hand on it.

A very satisfactory day ended, some might say unsurprisingly, with an uneaten cucumber raita.

Pickled Egg - Richard Beswick for a dropped catch.

R Earney's 40th 50
